## Foundation Layer

Before starting the 12 steps, establish these foundational elements:

### Core Purpose
- Why the company exists beyond making money
- Timeless and inspiring
- Example: "To inspire and nurture the human spirit" (Starbucks)

### Core Values
- 3-5 non-negotiable behaviors
- Actionable and differentiating
- Used for hiring/firing decisions
- Example: Happy, Hungry, Humble (Lencioni's Ideal Team Player)

### BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal)
- 10-25 year ambitious goal
- The "mountain you're climbing"
- Should be both audacious AND achievable
- Example: "Every desk and every home has a computer running Microsoft software" (Microsoft, 1980s)

### Profit/X (Economic Denominator)
- Single economic metric that drives decisions
- Answer: "If you could pick only ONE ratio to drive performance, what would it be?"
- Examples: Profit per employee, Profit per customer, Profit per store, Profit per aircraft departure (Southwest)

## Step 1: Gut It Out

**Purpose**: Create the initial 3HAG with gut-feel numbers before analysis.

### Process

1. **Set the date**: Identify fiscal year-end date 3 years away
2. **Individual exercise**: Each leader writes down privately:
   - Cash in the bank at that date
   - Top-line revenue for that fiscal year
   - Total "widgets" (Profit/X units) needed
3. **Share and discuss**: Compare numbers, discuss gaps, reach consensus
4. **Write the 3HAG statement**: One sentence describing the company in year 3 WITHOUT numbers

### Gut It Out Template

```
3HAG Date: [Fiscal year end, 3 years away]

Cash in Bank: $______
Revenue: $______
Widgets (Profit/X): ______

3HAG Statement (no numbers):
"In 3 years, we will be _________________________________"
```

### Key Insight
The purpose is to surface alignment gaps early. Large discrepancies between leaders' numbers indicate strategic misalignment that must be resolved.

## Step 2: Key Function Flow Map

**Purpose**: Understand how each function generates revenue and accelerates cash conversion.

### Process

1. List all key business functions
2. Map how each function connects to:
   - Revenue generation
   - Cash conversion cycle
   - Value delivery to customer
3. Identify bottlenecks and dependencies
4. Assign clear accountability for each function

### Key Functions to Map

- Sales
- Marketing
- Operations/Delivery
- Finance
- Customer Success
- Product/R&D
- HR/People

### Questions for Each Function

- How does this function directly or indirectly generate revenue?
- What's the handoff to the next function?
- Where are delays or bottlenecks?
- Who is accountable for this function's output?

---

## Step 3: Market Map

**Purpose**: Visualize your competitive landscape using Porter's Five Forces.

### The Five Forces

1. **Competitors** (center): Direct competitors in your space
2. **Customers** (right): Who buys from you, their power
3. **Suppliers** (left): Who you depend on, their power
4. **New Entrants** (top): Threat of new competitors
5. **Substitutes** (bottom): Alternative solutions

### Process

1. Draw the five forces diagram
2. List 3-5 entries for each force
3. Identify your differentiated niche
4. Find "white space" — underserved areas

### White Space Questions

- Where are competitors NOT focusing?
- What customer needs are unmet?
- What new delivery models exist?
- Where can you avoid direct competition?

---

## Step 4: Core Customer

**Purpose**: Define your ideal, most profitable customer profile.

### Core Customer Profile Template

```
Demographics:
- Role/Title:
- Company Size (revenue/employees):
- Industry:
- Geography:

Psychographics:
- Primary pain (in their words):
- Trigger event that causes buying:
- What they value most:
- Decision criteria:

Economics:
- Budget/spend on this problem:
- Lifetime value:
- Acquisition cost acceptable:
```

### Key Principle

"The key to success is having the right people with the right mindset, doing the right thing for the Core Customer. Having the right skill set isn't enough."

All strategy decisions flow from Core Customer. If you can't agree on Core Customer, you can't align on strategy.

### Validation Questions

- Would we be excited to clone this customer 100x?
- Is this customer profitable at scale?
- Can we reach them cost-effectively?
- Do they value what we uniquely offer?

---

## Step 5: Attribution Framework

**Purpose**: Discover your competitive "white space" by mapping attribute importance vs. current delivery.

### Process

1. **List attributes**: What attributes matter to your Core Customer? (8-12 attributes)
2. **Rate importance**: How important is each attribute to Core Customer? (1-5)
3. **Rate yourself**: How well do you deliver each attribute? (1-5)
4. **Rate competitors**: How well do competitors deliver? (1-5)
5. **Find gaps**: Where is importance high but delivery low across the market?

### Attribution Framework Template

| Attribute | Importance (1-5) | You (1-5) | Comp A (1-5) | Comp B (1-5) | Gap |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Speed     |                  |           |              |              |     |
| Price     |                  |           |              |              |     |
| Quality   |                  |           |              |              |     |
| Service   |                  |           |              |              |     |
| [Add more]|                  |           |              |              |     |

### Finding White Space

- High importance + Low market delivery = Opportunity
- You want to OWN attributes competitors don't focus on
- Avoid competing on the same dimensions as competitors

---

## Step 6: Activity Fit Map Level 1

**Purpose**: Identify 3-5 differentiating activities that create your unique position.

### What is a Differentiator?

A differentiator is an activity or capability that:
- Matters to your Core Customer
- You can deliver better than competitors
- Is difficult for competitors to copy
- Creates sustainable competitive advantage

### Process

1. Review Attribution Framework gaps
2. Identify activities that would close those gaps
3. Select 3-5 that reinforce each other
4. Test: Does each one support the others?

### Michael Porter's Three Differentiation Approaches

1. **Variety-based**: Serving select needs across many customers
2. **Needs-based**: Serving broad needs of specific customer segments
3. **Access-based**: Serving customers with different access requirements

### Activity Fit Map Template

```
Central Theme: [Your strategic focus]

Differentiator 1: ____________
  └── Supports: [which other differentiators]

Differentiator 2: ____________
  └── Supports: [which other differentiators]

Differentiator 3: ____________
  └── Supports: [which other differentiators]

Differentiator 4: ____________
  └── Supports: [which other differentiators]

Differentiator 5: ____________
  └── Supports: [which other differentiators]
```

## Step 7: One Phrase Strategy

**Purpose**: Distill your entire strategy into a single memorable phrase.

### Characteristics of Great One Phrase Strategy

- 3-8 words
- Memorable and repeatable
- Captures unique position
- Guides decisions
- Employees can explain it
- Customers recognize it

### Examples

- Southwest Airlines: "Short-haul, low-cost, point-to-point"
- IKEA: "Low-price, stylish, self-serve furniture"
- Enterprise Rent-A-Car: "We'll pick you up"

### Process

1. Review your differentiators
2. What's the thread connecting them?
3. Draft 5-10 options
4. Test: Can someone outside the company understand it?
5. Test: Does it guide daily decisions?

---

## Step 8: Activity Fit Map Level 2

**Purpose**: Map the supporting activities that enable each differentiator.

### Process

For each Level 1 differentiator, identify:
- 3-5 supporting activities required
- Resources needed
- Capabilities to build
- Processes to create

### Template

```
Differentiator 1: [Name]
├── Supporting Activity 1.1: ____________
├── Supporting Activity 1.2: ____________
├── Supporting Activity 1.3: ____________
└── Supporting Activity 1.4: ____________

Differentiator 2: [Name]
├── Supporting Activity 2.1: ____________
...
```

### Fit Test

Activities should create "fit" — they reinforce each other so:
- Competitors can't copy just one piece
- The whole is greater than the sum of parts
- Copying requires copying everything

---

## Step 9: Swimlanes

**Purpose**: Create a 12-quarter roadmap for developing each differentiator.

### Swimlane Structure

```
         Q1    Q2    Q3    Q4    Q5    Q6    Q7    Q8    Q9    Q10   Q11   Q12
         ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Diff 1   │ M1  │ M2  │ M3  │     │ M4  │     │ M5  │     │     │     │     │ M6  │
Diff 2   │     │ M1  │     │ M2  │     │ M3  │     │ M4  │     │     │ M5  │     │
Diff 3   │ M1  │     │     │ M2  │     │     │ M3  │     │     │ M4  │     │ M5  │
Diff 4   │     │ M1  │     │     │ M2  │     │     │ M3  │     │     │ M4  │     │
Diff 5   │     │     │ M1  │     │     │ M2  │     │     │ M3  │     │     │ M4  │
```

M = Milestone

### Process

1. Create 6-row by 12-column grid
2. Each row = one differentiator
3. For each differentiator, identify 3-6 milestones over 12 quarters
4. Place milestones to show progression
5. Check for dependencies across swimlanes
6. Ensure resources don't conflict

### Milestone Characteristics

- Specific and measurable
- Time-bound to a quarter
- Demonstrates progress toward full capability
- Has clear definition of "done"

## Step 10: 36-Month Rolling Forecast

**Purpose**: Build month-over-month financial projections tied to strategy.

### Components

1. **Revenue forecast**: Month by month for 36 months
2. **Widget forecast**: Profit/X units month by month
3. **Key assumptions**: What must be true for numbers to work
4. **Cash forecast**: Cash position month by month

### Template Structure

```
Month | Revenue | Widgets | Cash | Key Assumptions
──────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────┼─────────────────
M1    |         |         |      |
M2    |         |         |      |
...   |         |         |      |
M36   |         |         |      |
```

### Rolling Nature

- Update quarterly
- Add new quarter at end
- Track actuals vs. forecast
- Adjust assumptions based on reality

---

## Step 11: Brand Promise with Guarantee

**Purpose**: Define what customers can count on, with a guarantee that demonstrates confidence.

### Brand Promise

- 3-5 words that capture customer experience
- What you're known for
- Must be deliverable consistently

### Guarantee

- Specific commitment that proves the promise
- Has teeth — costs you if you fail
- Builds trust and differentiates

### Examples

| Company | Brand Promise | Guarantee |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Domino's | "30 minutes or less" | Free if late |
| Zappos | "Free shipping both ways" | 365-day returns |
| FedEx | "Absolutely, positively overnight" | Money back |

### Process

1. What do customers already say about you?
2. What SHOULD they say?
3. What would prove you mean it?
4. What guarantee would competitors be afraid to match?

---

## Step 12: Confirm Your 3HAG

**Purpose**: Validate the 3HAG with all the strategic work completed.

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Does the 3HAG still make sense given Market Map findings?
- [ ] Is it achievable given your Core Customer definition?
- [ ] Do the swimlanes add up to achieving it?
- [ ] Does the 36-month forecast support it?
- [ ] Can you articulate it with your One Phrase Strategy?
- [ ] Does the team believe in it?

### Refinement Process

1. Revisit Step 1 numbers with new information
2. Update 3HAG statement if needed
3. Ensure alignment across all 12 steps
4. Get explicit buy-in from leadership team

### Rolling Annual Update

Each year:
- Current 3HAG becomes 2HAG
- 2HAG becomes 1HAG (next year's plan)
- Create new 3HAG for 3 years out
- Always maintain 36-month forward view
